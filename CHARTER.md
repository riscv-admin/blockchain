# Blockchain Special Interest Group

Blockchain SIG is proposed to develop a strategy and provide oversights for blockchain technology and solutions in RISC-V architecture and software ecosystem.

The goals are to ensure there are no gaps in the ISA or software and it meets or exceeds industry expectation in performance and security. (e.g., privacy-preservation, cryptographic algorithms, trusted execution, data governance, data integrity and data provenance, etc.)

In addition, the blockchain SIG will work with the implementation on horizontal committees to make sure someone in the community develops a RISC-V based PoC (Proof of Concept) to ensure the whole stack from hardware to software meets the goals.

As with all groups, the SIG will engage and interact with other appropriate committees and groups.
